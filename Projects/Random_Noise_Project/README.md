# Image Noise Generator (In Progress)

This project is a Python-based image noise generator that creates various types of noise and applies them to images. The purpose of this project is to explore and understand different noise generation techniques, such as random noise, Perlin noise, and more.

## Introduction

Image noise is a random variation of brightness or color in an image, often used in computer graphics and simulations. This project aims to provide a Python tool to generate and apply different types of noise to images. Whether you are an artist, game developer, or researcher, this project can help you experiment with and visualize the effects of various noise techniques.

## Supported Noise Types

The following noise types are demonstrated:

1. **Random Noise**: Adds random intensity values to each pixel in the image.
2. **Perlin Noise**: Generates Perlin noise, a type of gradient noise, to create a smooth and natural-looking effect.
3. **Gaussian Noise**: Applies Gaussian distribution to add noise with a bell curve distribution.
4. **Salt-and-Pepper Noise**: Introduces salt and pepper-like pixels with extreme values, simulating black and white speckles.
5. **Uniform Noise**: Adds uniform noise, where the intensity of the noise is uniformly distributed.
6. **etc.**
